Extract ticket update details from the user's message.

Output ONLY a JSON object with these fields:
- "ticket_id": (required) the ticket identifier
- "status": (required) the new status

Valid statuses: planning, todo, open, in_progress, in_review, review, done, completed, closed, blocked.

Rules:
- Output ONLY valid JSON, no extra text.
- Preserve the exact ticket ID format the user provided.
- Map casual language to valid statuses (e.g. "finish" -> "done", "start" -> "in_progress", "block" -> "blocked").

Examples:
User: "move BZ-42 to in review"
{"ticket_id": "BZ-42", "status": "in_review"}

User: "I finished working on ticket 15"
{"ticket_id": "15", "status": "done"}
