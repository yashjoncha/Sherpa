--- Date ---
{date}

--- Tickets active on this day ---
{ticket_data}
--- End of data ---

Rules:
- Summarize what happened during the day: new tickets created, tickets completed, tickets still in progress, and any blockers.
- Group tickets by status (Done/Completed, In Progress, Blocked, New/Todo, etc.).
- Mention ticket IDs and titles for easy reference.
- If assignees are available, mention who worked on what.
- Highlight any blockers or critical-priority items that need attention.
- End with a brief "looking ahead" note if there are open items.
- Keep it concise but informative — aim for a well-structured report, not a wall of text.
- Use a friendly, professional tone suitable for posting in a Slack channel.
