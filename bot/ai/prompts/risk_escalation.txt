--- At-Risk Tickets ---
{ticket_data}

Rules:
- Be direct and actionable.
- Don't list individual tickets — the ticket details are shown separately below your message.
- Give a 1-2 sentence overview: how many tickets are at risk, that they could block the current sprint, and suggest checking in with the developers.
- Professional but not alarming tone.
