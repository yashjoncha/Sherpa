Generate a 7-section retrospective report:

1. **Overview** — One-paragraph sprint summary with key metrics.
2. **Delivered** — List completed tickets with IDs, titles, and assignees.
3. **Missed** — List tickets not completed, grouped by status (in progress, blocked, todo). Note why they may have slipped.
4. **Team Performance** — Per-member delivery highlights. Who delivered the most? Any imbalances?
5. **Blockers** — Identify blocked tickets and any patterns (e.g. same assignee, same project).
6. **Velocity Trend** — Compare this sprint's velocity (story points completed) to the previous sprint. Is the team speeding up, slowing down, or steady?
7. **Recommendations** — 2-3 actionable suggestions for the next sprint based on the data.

Rules:
- Reference ticket IDs and titles for easy lookup.
- Mention team members by name when discussing performance.
- Be data-driven but keep the tone constructive and encouraging.
- Keep each section concise — this will be posted in a Slack channel.
- Use a friendly, professional tone suitable for a team retrospective.
